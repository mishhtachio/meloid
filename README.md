Meloid = Melody + Monoid.

This is a command-line music player fully in Haskell for in-depth music lovers, 
yet under development.


Prerequisite

1. Make sure you have Magick and Chafa installed on your computer. They power
   the generic terminal image pipeline for image files and embedded MPD art.
2. To persist edits back into `config.yaml` while preserving comments and 
formatting, install `nodejs`, then run `npm install --prefix tools`. If you use 
a non-default Node executable, set `MELOID_NODE=/path/to/node`.

[x] Full mouse input support
[x] Real album art image display on terminals like Kitty, Ghostty and ITerm

Contributing

You seem to have noticed that there are many things not yet crossed in the roadmap. 
Do you have any ideas ? Great! However, you need to follow the following guidelines 
before you submit the patch.

- Please make sure the change you've made consistent with the code style in the 
project.
- Any big changes? Please talk to me first. Let's talk in issues, discussions or even 
Discord groups.
- Reliability is from a strong type system but also strengthened by every comment 
and documentation you make in your submission.
- It is not recommended to make any structural change to the codes. It is more 
preferred to focus on one specific issue in each contribution.
- I hope all warnings are intolerable for you
